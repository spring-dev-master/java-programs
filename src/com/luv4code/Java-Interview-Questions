        > public : it is access modifier, jvm will call anywhere in the application
        > static : it is also one kind modifier, it will use to call the jvm without creating object.
        > void : void is a return type, it will not return anything.

=> can we execute a java program without main method?
        yes, it is still jdk-6 version then after it will not executed.

        using static block:
            it is used to initialize static data members
            this block is executed before main method at the time of classloading.....

Singleton Class:
==================
    any java class is allowed to create only single object such type of class is called singleton class.
    ex: Runtime class, ActionServlet, ServiceLocator

    using : private constructor and factory method

    factory method:
        Bu using class name if we are calling a method and that returns the same class object such type of method is called factory method
        EX:
            Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();
            DateFormat df = DateFormat.getInstance();

        class Test{
            public static Test t = null;
            private Test(){
            }

            public static Test getTest(){
                if(t == null){
                    t = new Test();
                }
                return t;
            }

        }

> What is the disadvantage of immutable class?
    the only disadvantage of immutable class is that they require a separate object for each distinct value.Creating objects can costly especially if they are large.

        - avoid creating unnecessary objects and prefer lazy initialization
        - try to use standard library instead of writing your own from scratch.
        - wherever possible try to use primitive types instead of wrapper classes
        - Use strings carefully
        - algorithms implementation
        - always return empty collection /array instead of null
